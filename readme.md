> A surf cam analyzer

Surf breaks, especially ones with cameras are typically crowded. Which means going for a surf at the optimal time is crucial if you want to get a few waves. Typically, if you have no other commitments for the day, you'll check the spot camera through out the day comparing the wave quality & the crowd density to decide when to surf.

This project uses the surf camera stream to determine how many people are in the lineup, sampling 30s every 10 minutes. It then compares that with the surf report and logs that to a database. So you can see the spots crowd factor overtime.

With this you could:

1. Get notified when it's a good time to surf.
2. Predict when it's going to be a good time to surf.
